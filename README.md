# Basic-Data-Structures
Reprogrammed Data Structures in C++ 


These are some of the Assignments that were given to me during my winter semester of 2016. 

The Data structures created are by no means perfect and are comprised of mostly template classes since that was the format that the assignment
had to be in. 

Feel free to critique my work.
